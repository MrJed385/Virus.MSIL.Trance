# Virus.MSIL.Trance

Trance is a virus written in C# for danooct1's Viewer-Made Malware series. It is incredibly work-in-progress, however, even still there are lots of OSFirstTimer memes in it.

In fact, this virus was used in an OSFirstTimer episode where Diana had destroyed Windows 8 in a virtual machine using this virus. Unfortunately, it was in a buggy state and crashed near the end. Oh well.

At the time of writing this, the codebase is that used by them in the video.

### NOTE.

THIS IS AN ACTUAL COMPUTER VIRUS AND WILL DO DAMAGE IF YOU LET IT RUN ON ANYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT. I am not responsible for you destroying ALL YOUR DATA, neither is Victor Tran, or Philip Adams, because you were too lazy to run it in a virtual machine or on hardware with data you or loved ones do not care about.

Do not run this on a school computer. Do not run this at work as a prank. Do not run this at home as a prank. All three instances may require at least a restore of data backups if said backups were not on drive C:\, and worst-case scenario your PC will try to execute a picture of an angry Victor Tran as x86 or amd64 machine code.
